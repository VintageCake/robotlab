# robotlab

A little TCP project cooked up for the robotics department (that never got submitted)

Acts as an abstraction layer between an application that can only handle a single socket, and this program which handles multiple sockets.

I.e just a python program that takes data from multiple sockets and shoves it down a single socket.
